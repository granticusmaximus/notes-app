The company reported sales that topped forecasts, thanks in part to a double-digit increase in volume for its 7.5-ounce mini cans. The smaller-sized cans appeal to more health-conscious consumers who are increasingly watching what they drink and eat but may not want to switch to diet sodas that contain artificial sweeteners and other chemicals. The word "diet" did not appear once in the companys earnings release and was not mentioned on the conference call with analysts on Friday morning either.',

The case is named after the Persian phrase tamám shud, meaning "ended" or "finished," which was printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the fob pocket of the mans trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyám, authored by 12th-century poet, Omar Khayyám. Tamám was misspelt as Tamán in many early reports, and this error has often been repeated, leading to confusion about the name in the media.',
